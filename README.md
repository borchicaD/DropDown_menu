# DropDown_menu,
JSON data, JavaScript,
I took json data from another task and make some changes so I can retrive data for this mini project. I used json validator online to check for mistakes.
I used XMLHttpRequest to get json data, and with javascript find how to make a function that is automaticaly making list for all parent <li> elements and their children if there is any.
